## Installation
Easiest way to install is via `install_github` from the `devtools` package.

```R
install.packages('devtools') # if you haven't already installed this package and dependencies
library(devtools) # load the library
install_github("TEST-BNL/R-Canopy_Photosynthesis") # install the package from GitHub
```

If you want a specific branch, do `install_github(..., ref="<branch>")`.

From there, you should be able to load the package in your typical R session.
